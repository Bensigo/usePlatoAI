# PR Review

PR review exists to catch defects, unclear behavior, missing verification, and avoidable operational risk.

Review should be direct and actionable. Do not use review as a place for vague taste comments.

## Review Priorities

Inspect in this order:

1. Correctness and regressions.
2. Security, privacy, and data loss risk.
3. Missing tests or weak verification.
4. Product behavior mismatches.
5. Maintainability issues that will matter soon.
6. Style only when it affects clarity or consistency.

## Required Review Checks

Confirm:

- PR links the relevant issue.
- Scope matches the issue.
- Relevant project memory was recalled or the PR explains why none applied.
- Acceptance criteria are satisfied.
- PR includes an acceptance criteria coverage table.
- Each acceptance criterion has concrete implementation evidence.
- Each acceptance criterion has verification evidence.
- Verification commands or manual checks are listed.
- UI-visible work includes visual evidence.
- Memory changes, if present, are source-linked and not generic advice.
- No unrelated files or refactors are included.
- No secrets, credentials, or sensitive customer data are committed.

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

Treat the linked issue's acceptance criteria as the review contract. For each criterion:

- Confirm the PR body maps it to implementation evidence.
- Confirm the listed verification actually proves the criterion.
- Inspect the diff when the PR body evidence is vague or overstated.
- File a finding when any criterion is missing, only partially implemented, or verified by assertion instead of evidence.

Missing or weak acceptance criteria coverage is at least a `P1` when it blocks knowing whether the issue is actually complete. Use `P2` only when the gap is narrow and the implemented behavior is still clearly correct.

## Project Memory Checks

Before reviewing, run:

```bash
agentrail memory recall "<PR title, linked issue, feature, or key terms>"
```

Use relevant memory to check whether the PR repeats known mistakes or violates source-linked project preferences. Memory is advisory: if it conflicts with current code, `CONTEXT.md`, ADRs, the issue, or the PRD, call out the conflict and prefer the current source of truth.

Block memory changes when they are unsourced, too broad to be useful, duplicate canonical docs, or contain secrets, customer data, credentials, or private personal data.

When a review reveals a recurring pattern that future agents would realistically repeat, propose a source-linked memory suggestion instead of editing memory directly. Use `docs/agents/github-pr-reviewer.md` for the machine-readable schema when an AFK workflow needs to create follow-up `memory-suggestion` issues.

## Finding Format

Use this structure for actionable findings:

- Severity: `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, or `P3`.
- File and line, when possible.
- Concrete problem.
- Why it matters.
- Suggested correction.

Severity guide:

- `P0`: must fix immediately; breaks production, security, or data integrity.
- `P1`: must fix before merge.
- `P2`: should fix before merge unless explicitly accepted.
- `P3`: minor improvement or follow-up.

## Review Output Routing

After an agent review is complete, apply `pr-reviewed` to the PR or linked tracking issue if the workflow supports it.

- `P0` findings must create a new GitHub issue labeled `review-fix` and `ready-for-agent`.
- Reusable review patterns may create a new issue labeled `memory-suggestion` and `ready-for-agent` for human review before memory is edited.
- Non-`P0` findings should be left as PR review comments unless the maintainer explicitly wants a tracking issue.
- Do not bury production-breaking, security, data-loss, or merge-blocking findings in PR comments only.

For AFK review workflows, include one machine-readable block when follow-up work exists:

```text
BEGIN_REVIEW_FIX_ISSUES_JSON
{
  "fix_issues": [],
  "memory_suggestions": []
}
END_REVIEW_FIX_ISSUES_JSON
```

## Non-Findings

Do not block a PR for:

- Personal style preferences.
- Broad rewrites unrelated to the issue.
- Speculative architecture concerns without concrete risk.
- Missing work that was explicitly out of scope.

Document those as follow-ups only when they are worth tracking.
